# Smart Phone Store

This is a simple web-based project for a Smart Phone Store. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to create a basic HTML layout for a phone store. It includes a list of phones, with their images, prices, and a link to their respective websites.

## Project Structure

The project contains a single HTML file with the following components:

- **Header**: The main header contains the title of our page, which is styled to be center aligned with a gray background.

- **Table**: This is the main content of our page. It is a table that lists different phones. Each row in the table represents a different phone and includes the phone's name, an image, the price, and a link to the phone on its respective website.

- **Form**: At the end of the page, there is a simple form where users can enter their name and email, choose a date, and submit the form. Currently, the form action is set to Google's homepage and the method is `GET`.

## Usage

To use the project, simply open the HTML file in any web browser.
